# workNoiseMixer
mix white, pink and brown noise via a terminal app.

## WHY?  
see https://add.org/brown-noise-adhd

- Improved focus and productivity: This ambient noise can help to stimulate the ADHD brain as well as drown out surrounding background sounds and chatter that might distract you.
- Reduced stress: Some people find that listening to brown noise produces a calming sensation due to its deeper frequency and sound.
- Enhanced relaxation and sleep: Due to the soothing effects of brown noise, it can help promote relaxation. It may also help muffle noises around you at night, allowing you to fall asleep faster.

This solves a problem I have where I have been listening to YouTube brown noise mixers and then forgot about them and suddenly they will swap over to some other video with people talking etc.
